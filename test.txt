search spider test file
and plan of action.

what you basically have to do is figure out how to first find a file with the search string
included in it, like if you're searching for a string like "ed" it
should be able to find files with names like "education.txt" and "mr.ed" etc.
Once you can do that, while printing the absolute path for each,
you then need to use recursion. That requires you to call that original function
with slightly different parameters. You should be able to do all of this in one function.



this was my plan and I was unable to get anything productive to happen with my 4 tries so far.
I am just turning in what I have because I am pretty sure it is due. I will keep working on it.
